I have used the NASA Log file (July 1995) in this project.
The aim of the project is to analyse the dataset using Pyspark to gain interesting insights regarding host activities from Germany, Canada and Singapore.
The results are potrayed in graphs which can be used by NASA to strategically retain the hosts from the above countries.
